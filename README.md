## Project Overview

This project aims to create a self-balancing robot that can maintain its upright position while navigating various terrains. Utilizing sensors and motors controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, the robot adjusts its movements in real-time to achieve balance.

## Features

- Real-time balancing using gyroscope and accelerometer sensors
- Simple and efficient control algorithms
- Modular design for easy customization and upgrades
- Comprehensive documentation for setup and usage

## Hardware Requirements

To build the self-balancing robot, you will need the following components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano)
- Gyroscope/accelerometer module (e.g., MPU6050)
- Motor driver (e.g., L298N)
- DC motors with wheels
- Chassis for the robot
- Battery pack
- Jumper wires and breadboard (optional)

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (version 1.8 or higher)
- Libraries:
  - `Wire.h` (for I2C communication)
  - `MPU6050.h` (for sensor data)
  - `Servo.h` (if using servo motors)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-balancing-robot.git
   ```
2. Open the `self-balancing.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Install the necessary libraries if prompted.
4. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
5. Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
6. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

Once the code is uploaded successfully, power on the robot. It should automatically start balancing itself. You can experiment with different terrains and observe how the robot adjusts its movements to maintain balance.
